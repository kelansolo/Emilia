BE AWARE
If you change the master, make sure it still works (so compile and execute it on the robot)
We only have one version for everyone so be very careful not to modify someone elses code !!


- in mission_overide on github add your lines, and save the file
- get into Emilia/mission_overide/build
- write the following commands:
%-------------
  cmake ..
  make -j3
%-------------
These command should compile everything
- Now you should be in the directory build, to execute the code write "./mission"
