BE AWARE
If you change the master, make sure it still works (so compile and execute it on the robot)
We only have one version for everyone so be very careful not to modify someone elses code !!


- in mission_overide on github add your lines, and save the file
- get into Emilia, then directory Emilia
- write "git pull" in the terminal (it should update the files)
- then go into mission_overide in the directory Emilia and write the following commands:
%-------------
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j3
%-------------
These command should compile everything
- Now you should be in the directory build, to execute the code write "./mission"
